# Webpacker has been retired

**DO NOT MODIFY THIS REPO**

This is a clone of [rails/webpacker v6.0.0.beta.7](https://github.com/rails/webpacker/tree/v6.0.0.beta.7) and an additional [backport](https://github.com/rails/webpacker/commit/f8dbc91c9442e43529da8e08e5ac486d62c398cd) for Psych 4 incompatibility. Webpacker is no longer actively maintained and it's recommended to switch to [shakapacker](https://github.com/shakacode/shakapacker).
